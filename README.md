### Keycloack Flows

### How to run it

Firstly, you need to create the docker network:

`$ docker network create keycloak_network`

Then, you need to run the docker-compose files

**Disclaimer**
I've pushed the .docker folder inside the keycloak path, just to make easy the execution, so you didn't need to create a new realm or a client. It's only for testing purpose.
